## 2026-04-05 (Marathon session — infra + UI polish + intelligence pass)

**Theme:** Stand up GCP backend, unify the rider experience, start personalizing Cadence.

### Infra / backend
- [Rossella+Beau] [new] Deployed pose API to GCP from scratch via terraform. Cloud Run service live at `horsera-pose-api-680892443107.us-east4.run.app`. Goran's crop_rider_pose PR merged and running (YOLOv8m + smart crop + horse detection).
- [Beau] [fix] CPU worker defaulted to 512MB RAM → OOM on YOLOv8m. Raised to 2 vCPU / 4Gi.
- [Beau] [new] CORS headers added to `api/pose.js` Vercel proxy so localhost dev can hit the prod pose proxy.

### Video testing / ops
- [Beau] [new] Horse-detection pipeline (YOLOv8n locally) to auto-trim 22 full-length iPhone ride videos → 20s 720p H.264 clips for testing. Date-based filenames, motion-aware window selection.

### Rides + ride detail UI
- [Lauren+Beau] [code] Ride cards restructured to 2-col layout: content left, 92×92 video thumbnail right with score ring overlaid in bottom-right corner.
- [Lauren+Beau] [code] Collapsible month groups with trajectory sparkline (first score → line → last score + delta) replacing "avg X" text. Default: all collapsed for progress-at-a-glance.
- [Beau] [fix] Date off-by-one bug eliminated — `new Date(ride.date)` replaced with local-date parsing helper in `lib/utils.ts`.
- [Beau] [fix] Ride duration now derived from actual video duration, not hardcoded 45min.
- [Lauren+Beau] [code] Video thumbnails on ride cards (seek to t=2s) replaced the "VIDEO" text chip.
- [Lauren+Beau] [code] Swipe-to-delete fixed — whole red strip is the tap target. Trash icon on hover for web.
- [Lauren+Beau] [code] Optional ride name + notes via pen icon next to title. Apple Notes style, no modal. Replaced a dashed "+ Add a name or note" button Rossella rejected as 90s-functional.
- [Lauren+Beau] [code] Date conflict preview during save — thumbnail/duration/score of existing ride + explicit Replace or Save-as-new.
- [Beau] [fix] Date picker opens native calendar on first click (showPicker API).

### Cadence + insights
- [Beau] [new] Ride Detail Cadence card: full-width primary CTA using real CadenceIcon from the FAB. Two context-specific suggested prompts below as compact pills.
- [Beau] [code] Cadence Pattern Insight on Progress page is DATA-DRIVEN: derives strongest + weakest biomechanics from windowed rides, compares first/second half for weak-metric trend, picks headline by score spread.
- [Beau] [new] Fun-fact carousel during analysis cycles through all 25 facts (Fisher-Yates shuffled fresh-first), avoiding within-session repeats.

### Progress page
- [Beau] [code] Header shows rider name (not horse) + score as ring consistent with ride cards + month headers.
- [Beau] [code] Progression Signal card live — derived from latest ride's biomechanics.
- [Beau] [new] Biomechanics Trends redesigned: 2-col small-multiples sparkline grid replacing horizontal-scroll bar chart. X-axis labeled "oldest → newest". Gaps where data missing.

### Journey page
- [Beau] [new] Level auto-inference (beta) from last 3 rides' average overall score if rider hasn't set a level manually. Small "Inferred · Beta" chip next to level header.

### Design system / scoring
- [Beau] [code] Score-band scale expanded 3 → 5 tiers everywhere: Excellent (≥90), On target (≥75), Working (≥60), Building (≥40), Focus area (<40).
- [Beau] [code] Score ring text bumped from 18px → 30px.
- [Beau] [code] Riding Quality labels: Mastered / Consistent / Developing / Emerging / Focus.

### Cleanup
- [Beau] [fix] Deleted stale dead code: old `RideDetailPage.tsx` v1, `InsightsPage.tsx`, `VideoSilhouetteOverlay.tsx`, never-opened `RideDetailView` block (~400 lines). Bundle shrunk ~18 KB. This was the cause of old layouts flashing briefly during transitions.
- [Beau] [fix] "Add a Ride" omnipresent FAB removed.
- [Beau] [fix] Video player fullscreen button collision fixed; native volume + FS re-enabled.

### Memory / principles
- [Ross+Daniel] [docs] Saved Rossella's UI principle to permanent memory + `_agents/FEEDBACK.md`: Horsera UI must be Apple/Oura caliber. No dashed reveals, no 90s-functional patterns, icons over button-text, every pixel justified.

## 2026-03-12 (Video Analysis Rebuild — Issues 1–3)

- [Lauren] [design] [new] ISSUE 2 — "The Rider Map" body diagram designed and built
  - Two-column layout: SVG rider diagram (left) + metric score list (right)
  - Rider: side-view dressage skeleton, thick rounded pill-shaped limbs (not a stick figure)
  - Each body segment colored by its metric: torso=Core, arms=Rein Steadiness/Symmetry, leg=Lower Leg, hip=Pelvis, head/shoulder=Upper Body
  - Inline score % labels next to relevant joints (DM Mono font)
  - Horse barrel at bottom — immediately recognisable as equestrian
  - Parchment background + radial gradient glow behind figure — warm, not clinical
  - Overall score shown at bottom of metric list
  - Unmistakably Horsera — not a copy of Ridesum's dark clinical diagram
- [Lauren] [design] [new] ISSUE 3 — Riding Quality panel designed
  - Layer 2 (USDF Scales of Training) order: Rhythm → Relaxation → Contact → Impulsion → Straightness → Balance
  - Each quality: Playfair Display name, gradient bar, score %, score label badge, "driven by X" metric
  - Derived algorithmically from Layer 1 biometrics — makes the four-layer model visible
- [Beau] [code] [new] `poseAnalysis.ts`: added `computeRidingQualities()` — 6 Layer 2 scores from biometrics
- [Beau] [code] [new] `VideoAnalysis.tsx` — complete rebuild with tabs
  - Tab 1 "Movement": Movement Insights text cards (Layer 1→Layer 2 narratives)

- [Beau] [code] RideDetailPage: passes `mockBiometrics={ride.biometrics}` to VideoAnalysis
- [Beau] [code] Build passes ✅ (same bundle size, no regressions)

## 2026-03-11 (Pose Pipeline Session — TASKS 1–5)

- [Ross] [product] TASK 1 — Model selection: MoveNet Thunder chosen over MediaPipe, ViTPose, OpenPose, YOLO-Pose. Decision logged in DECISIONS.md.
- [Ross] [product] TASK 3 — Metric definitions: all 6 biomechanics metrics defined as relative-position stability calculations (relative to hip/shoulder anchors to remove camera drift). Documented in DECISIONS.md.
- [Lauren] [design] TASK 4 — Visualization Direction A selected: skeleton overlay on real video thumbnail, joints colored by metric score (green/champagne/red). Direction B (stability trace) logged as post-MVP.
- [Beau] [code] [new] `src/lib/poseAnalysis.ts` — pure metric computation library
  - `KP` constants: all 17 MoveNet keypoint indices
  - `SKELETON_CONNECTIONS`: 12 body segment pairs for skeleton drawing
  - `JOINT_REGIONS`: maps each joint to its biomechanics metric (for color coding)
  - `computeBiometricsFromFrames()`: computes all 6 metrics from pose frame array
  - `generateInsights()`: generates 4 Layer1→Layer2 narrative insights with trend arrows
- [Beau] [code] [new] `src/hooks/useVideoAnalysis.ts` — React hook for full video pipeline
  - Dynamic imports: `@tensorflow/tfjs` + `@tensorflow-models/pose-detection` load only on first video upload (keeps main bundle size unchanged)
  - Detector cached after first load — subsequent analyses skip model download
  - Samples video at 5-second intervals (capped at 600 frames) for stability metric accuracy
  - Returns: `{ status, progress, result, error, analyzeVideo, reset }`
  - `VideoAnalysisResult` includes: biometrics, insights, frameCount, thumbnailDataUrl, representativeFrame (keypoints)
- [Lauren+Beau] [code] [new] `src/components/ui/VideoAnalysis.tsx` — full video analysis UI component

  - State 3 (error): error message + retry button
  - State 4 (videoUploaded mock): mock SVG skeleton + "Upload video for live AI analysis" CTA overlay
  - State 5 (no video): "Add a video" dashed card
  - Skeleton SVG uses viewBox="0 0 1 1" with normalized keypoint coordinates — scales to any display size
- [Beau] [code] [fix] `RideDetailPage.tsx`: replaced ~120 lines of hardcoded mock SVG + insights with `<VideoAnalysis>` component + `useVideoAnalysis` hook. `generateInsights()` now drives the mock insight text for existing rides.
- [Beau] [code] Build passes ✅ (409KB main bundle; TF.js chunks are code-split, load on demand only)
